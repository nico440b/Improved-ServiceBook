# Changelog

## [0.9.0] - 19-11-2018
### Added
- Added exception handling where it was needed.
- You will now receive an error message when you use an invalid value when creating a new service. 

### Changed
- Completely rebuilt the GUI to make it (arguably) more appealing and user friendly. 
- Moved GUI code to FXML to remove clutter from main and make it easier to read.
- Each tab now has itâ€™s own controller class (everything was shoved into main before).
